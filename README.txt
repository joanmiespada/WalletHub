Dear developer, 

Thank you for your time in eval my code. I hope to be rise to the challenge. I've tried follow the instrucctions. Only, the last exercice you'll need a maven to download one dependency. I'd like add cucumber's tests cases, however, it will break the folder structure that you've provided in the PDF.  

Should you have any doubt, don't hesitate to call me.   

Best Regards,

Joan Miquel Espada,
